# 6. Define a function `overlapping()` that takes two lists and
# returns True if they have at least one member in common,
# False otherwise. You may use your `is_member()` function,
# or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise,
# you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.

# Its work

# first = input("Enter first lists: ").split()
# second = input("Enter second lists: ").split()


# def overlapping(first, second):
#     for f in first:
#         for s in second:
#             if f == s:
#                 return True
#     return False
#
# print(overlapping(first, second))


# Work for SET
# count = fist.intersection(sec)
# + count
