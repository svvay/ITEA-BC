The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the
suffix -s, which is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs.
 A simple set of rules can be given as follows:
If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies If the verb ends  By default just add s Your task in this exercise is to
 define a function make_3sg_form() which given a verb in infinitive form returns
 its third person singular form. Test your function with words like try, brush,
 run and fix. Note however that the rules must be regarded as heuristic, in the
 sense that you must not expect them to work for all cases. Tip: Check out the string method endswith().
